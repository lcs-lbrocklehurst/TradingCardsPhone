let ColeCaufield = Card(name: "Cole Caufield", image: "Caufield", height: "5'7", weight: "162", shoots: "right", birthdate: "1/2/2001", gamesPlayed: "123", goals: "53", assists: "31", points: "84", penaltyMinutes: "14", description: "A game-breaking goal scorer that, despite his diminutive frame, thrives under pressure and is difficult to contain. Defensively, he’s uncomfortable having the puck in his own end for long and he’ll make the extra effort to pressure around the blue line and take away cross-ice options. Upon procuring puck possession, he’ll be the first to explode up ice in-transition. The hallmark of his game is his exceptional goal-scoring ability.")

let ArberXhekaj = Card(name: "Arber Xhekaj", image: "Xhekaj", height: "6'4", weight: "238", shoots: "left", birthdate: "1/30/2001", gamesPlayed: "47", goals: "5", assists: "8", points: "13", penaltyMinutes: "92", description: "The undrafted defenseman earned an NHL job by laying out punishing checks in his own zone and standing up for teammates, but he is more than just a physical blueliner; he is showing he can also contribute offensively because of his skating ability and poise with the puck. He will have to avoid being baited into penalties by opponents who hope to use his toughness against him.")

let JurajSlafkovsky = Card(name: "Juraj Slafkovsky", image: "Slafkovsky", height: "6'4", weight: "238", shoots: "left", birthdate: "3/30/2004", gamesPlayed: "39", goals: "4", assists: "6", points: "10", penaltyMinutes: "33", description: "The MVP of the 2022 Beijing Olympics helped Slovakia win the bronze medal before being taken No. 1 overall in the 2022 NHL Draft. He has all the positives a team would want from a big forward: the size to power his way past opponents, as well as the speed and skill to create offense. He can set up or finish plays, and his compete level should get better as he matures.")
